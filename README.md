# Gun deaths in USA


In this project, we are working with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on gun deaths in the US. The dataset came from FiveThirtyEight. The dataset is stored in the guns.csv file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim.

Here are some potential next steps:

Figure out the link, if any, between month and homicide rate.
Explore the homicide rate by gender.
Explore the rates of other intents, like Accidental, by gender and race.
Find out if gun death rates correlate to location and education.
